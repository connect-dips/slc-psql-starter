This is meant for quick reference for rapid application development and prototyping. Ensure you have PostgreSQL running on your local machine on port 5432. You are free to edit the PostgreSQL config at `/server/datasource.json` as per your requirement.

1. Clone the repo and `npm install` to install all the node dependencies.
2. Then `node .` will run the slc on port 3000 and api explorer in http://localhost:3000/explorer


Thanks
